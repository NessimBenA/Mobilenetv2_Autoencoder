MobileNetV2 Autoencoder for Image Reconstruction
This is a PyTorch implementation of a MobileNetV2-based Convolutional Autoencoder for image reconstruction tasks. The autoencoder leverages the efficient Inverted Residual Blocks from the MobileNetV2 architecture to create a lightweight and efficient autoencoder for image reconstruction tasks. It can be used for unsupervised learning, dimensionality reduction, and feature learning in computer vision applications.
